# Background and Literature Review:
As we shift to a more digital world, the risk of biometric identity theft for malicious purposes increases. Additionally, in matters like identity verification, challenges in signature matching can lead to significant problems. For example, during the 2020 election, all ballots were mailed in, and election officials visually compared signatures on the ballots to those on file to assess their validity. This process led to many ballots being thrown out altogether, and it also disproportionately affected minority voters. It leads us to question how the human eye could possibly discern little differences in handwriting. In fact, an academic article even cites the intricate factors that make up a unique handwriting, including writing movement, stroke formation, slant, etc. More recently, different companies, including Notarize, an online real estate service provider, have begun introducing new digital signature platforms that bind identity through ID documentation and selfie biometrics. By streamlining the signature recognition process, companies like Notarize are also demonstrating how it will only become more important in the years to come. Given these developments, it becomes all-the-more urgent to have a standardized and proven machine learning method to correctly identify and distinguish signatures.
